1.1 - Various updates, fixes, and entered the Chrome Extension detail for Chrome/web store
1.2 - Added a manual page refresh to update the page. MS Ajax is inteferring with the built in page refresh of the webpage
    - Extension was running on other report pages of the queue because of the Table ID. Forced to run on specific url
1.3 - Added the hour counter to keep track of people in the queue for more then 1 hour.
    - The extension now auto. sorts the viewing table by State Duration (time in status)
1.4 - Fixed the seconds bug, where it would disregard multiple people at the same minute park, and only count one
      It would only keep track of the first extension that is checked at that minute mark
